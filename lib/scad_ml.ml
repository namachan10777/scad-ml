(** 3-dimensional vector type.

    In addition to basic math and vector operations, relevant transformation
    functions (and aliases) are mirroring those found in {!module:Scad} are
    provided. This allows for points in space represented by this type to moved
    around in a similar fashion to {!Scad.t}. *)

  (** [multmatrix m t]

      Apply affine transformation matrix [m] to the vector [t]. *)
  let multmatrix = MultMatrix.transform

  (** [quaternion q t]

      Rotate [t] with the quaternion [q]. *)
  let quaternion = Quaternion.rotate_vec3

  (** [quaternion_about_pt q p t]

      Translates [t] along the vector [p], rotating the resulting vector with
      the quaternion [q], and finally, moving back along the vector [p].
      Functionally, rotating about the point in space arrived at by the initial
      translation along the vector [p]. *)
