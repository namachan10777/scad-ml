(** [nearby_idxs ?min_tree_size ?radius path p]

    Find the indices of points within [radius] (default = [1e-9]) distance from
    the target point [p] in [path]. Match indices will be returned in arbitrary
    order (unsorted). When [path] is provided (eagerly on partial application),
    the length will be checked and a function to perform the search will be
    generated. If [path] is shorter than [min_tree_size], it will be a simple
    direct search otherwise a {!BallTree2.t} will be constructed. Thus, if you
    plan to search for more than one target point, take care to apply this
    function in two steps to avoid repeated length checks and closure/tree
    generations. *)

(** [square ?center dims]

    angle [start]. If [wedge] is [true], [centre] will be included as the last
    point of the returned path (default = [false]).

    Draw an arc between the points [p1] and [p2], about [centre]. [dir] can be
   provided to enforce clockwise or counter-clockwise winding direction. By
   default, the direction is computed automatically, though if [centre], [p1],
   and [p2] do not form a valid triangle (they're collinear), an
   [Invalid_argument] exception will be raised if [dir] is not provided.

(** [offset ?fn ?fs ?fa ?closed ?check_valid spec path]

    Offset a 2d [path] (treated as [closed] by default) by the [spec]ified amount.
    - [`Delta d] will create a new outline whose sides are a fixed distance [d]
      (+ve out, -ve in) from the original outline.
    - [`Chamfer d] fixed distance offset by [d] as with delta, but with corners
      chamfered.
    - [`Radius r] creates a new outline as if a circle of some radius [r] is
      rotated around the exterior ([r > 0]) or interior ([r < 0]) original
      outline. [fn], [fs], and [fa] parameters govern the number of points that
      will be used for these arcs (they are ignored for delta and chamfer modes).
    - The [check_valid] default of [`Quality 1] will check the validity of
      shifted line segments by checking whether their ends and [n] additional
      points spaced throughout are far enough from the original path. If there are
      no points that have been offset by the target [d], a [Failure] exception will
      be raised. Checking can be turned off by setting this to [`No]. *)

(** [self_intersection ?eps ?closed path]

    points will be considered (default = [false]). *)
val self_intersections : ?eps:float -> ?closed:bool -> t -> t

(** [is_simple ?eps ?closed path]

    Return [true] if [path] is simple, e.g. contains no (paralell) reversals or

   Nonzero rule} is followed, wherein a point is considered inside the polygon
   formed by [t] regardless of the number of times the containing regions
   overlap, by default this is [false], and the
